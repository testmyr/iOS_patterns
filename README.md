# VIPERTrainingApp

The app based on the [Apple sample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/browsing_and_modifying_photo_albums) allows to view the iOS gallery images, upload them(by the clicking on) to the server storage as one by one on a queue. The uploading is supported some time in the background mode.
